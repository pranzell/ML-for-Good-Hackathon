9c5b1656,"Bring at the upper end of the 50-59 demographic, very many friends are of similar ages or greater, and so there are many friends and family members to be concerned about. So a first worrying phase of this has been contacting people and making sure they are aware of risks and keeping safe. But the other VERY worrying thing, if you are close to 60 and male (but with no known pre-existing conditions), is that while you do not come into the most vulnerable groups, there is still a risk of death, and a greater risk of a very unpleasant spell in ICU. Yet Government policy is geared towards protecting the even higher risk groups. So you wonder what the heck to do if/when lockdown is lifted - do you just go and take the risk? Now as a poker player I look at risk and percentages in a different way to most people. 1-2% risk of death is not huge, but it is still risk or ruin that you want to avoid if at all possible. 5-15% risk of hospitalisation is a very sizeable risk of something very unpleasant indeed. So from the beginning where people were saying 'oh it's like flu, it's just a 1% risk', I have been very concerned. Of course if you put it to those same people that if they get on a plane, it has a 1% chance of crashing, they would be off it pronto. Unfortunately in the UK our Government has screwed up in typical British amateur public school fashion and listened to the small group of scientists advising them (SAGE, whose membership and minutes are kept secret) who went for an influenza mitiation/herd immunity approach, where NZ and Asian countries went for a full SARS/elimination approach. So we are stuck here with a policy based on exposing 80% of the population to it over a number of waves (with maybe 40l+ deaths), to get immunity that may not be long-lasting if it really exists at all. And if you want to be in the 20% not exposed, then it could be isolation for 12 months or more.    And the Prime Minister, who failed to interrogate the advice from SAGE, and failed to convene COBRA until March (spending his time instead on Brexit and/or finishing his book on Shakespeare) has not only paid the price of it himself with illness, but left us with a rudderless government by nonentities while he recuperate at Chequers (and/orfinishes his book on Shakespeare).  When you find yourself agreeing with every word of Piers Morgan, you know you have slipped into a terrible alternate reality.  ","Very concerned about my French relatives who refuse to get vaccinated (including  a 90 year old).
