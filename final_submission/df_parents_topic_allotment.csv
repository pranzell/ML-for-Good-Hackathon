It's a negative for everyone else, but for us, it's generally improved the emotional well being of our family.  Obviously this is only a benefit short term as social development is very important.  Our son is home educated and the number of online programs increased alongside a better acceptance and understanding of home schooling from others.  We have always received our shopping through a veg box scheme and since the veg can no longer be chosen the boxes contain some more unusual items.  This has leed to an inventiveness and love of cooking in my son.  He has practised violin more and more children like him have been playing Minecraft online which has given him the kind of social interaction he actually enjoys.  I was very sick and couldn't breathe properly.  He used this time to research the virus, lung problems and how best to help me.  This led his to a greater commitment to his dreams of working in the medical profession in the future and also helped him define emotional connections in a way he previously struggled with.. Being Autistic, he was not so keen on socialising generally and prefers socialising (with supervision) playing games like Minecraft online.  Social distancing and isolation has led to a rise in online gaming and a greater number of children wishing to socialise in a way he feels comfortable with.  My son hopes to work in the medical field when he grows up, the increased discussion and the raising of social support for the NHS has given him a greater hope for the future.  Now all children have been exposed to home education there has been a huge increase in both available programs and study material online and also fewer people assuming he just plays all day.  Hes very scholarly and this assumption has always distressed him.. my son is autistic and prefers personal space and less busy environments.  He has found it much easier to leave the house knowing that personal space would be respected.  He also has had to attend fewer social engagements and this is ideal for him.. My son is autistic and prefers to engage socially online or through playing games.  The lack of social pressure has been pleasant for him.  He has enjoyed the quieter streets as he has SPD.",autistic household quarantine reduce pressure relate social expectation gathering negative everyone else we generally improve emotional well our family obviously benefit short term social development important our son home educate number program increase alongside well acceptance understand home schooling other always receive our shopping veg box scheme since veg can long choose box contain unusual item leed inventiveness love cooking son practise violin child like play minecraft which give kind social interaction actually enjoy sick could not breathe properly use time research virus lung problem how good help lead his great commitment his dream work medical profession future also help define emotional connection way previously struggle .. autistic not keen socialising generally prefer socialise supervision playing game like minecraft social distance isolation lead rise gaming great number child wish socialise way feel comfortable son hope work medical field when grow increase discussion raise social support nhs give great hope future child expose home education huge increase available program study material also few people assume play day scholarly assumption always distressed .. son autistic prefer personal space less busy environment find much easy leave house know personal space would respect also attend few social engagement ideal .. son autistic prefer engage socially playing game lack social pressure pleasant enjoy quiet street spd,-1,0.0
