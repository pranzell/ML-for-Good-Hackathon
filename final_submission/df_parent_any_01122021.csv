We couldn't even go out and buy shoes for her and had to order online and she has high physical sensitivities so the likelihood of these shoes being ok is very low.  It all creates extra stress and worry.","My daughter has missed out on a lot of social contact and her usual groups.  She has lost a friend as she saw this person weekly at a group and now they both have decided not to return to it and although they occasionally text, her friend has autism and has regressed and won't talk on the phone or skype or meet up so she is sad about that.  Returning to groups has been scary and stressful for her.  She has lost a musical theatre teacher and got a new one.  She was due to be taking a musical theatre exam and now it is pushed back to i don't know when.  She has missed out on her relationship in person with extended family.  She has missed out on holidays, dance shows, birthday parties, days out.  She has sensory issues and so choosing clothes and not being able to try them on is awful and causes so much stress because when we bring stuff home, she gets attached to it and doesn't want to return it even if it is not comfortable.  Her dad was really ill with covid in November, we were worried about him, he had to self isolate in a room in the house for 3 weeks, as we were worried my elderly mother who lives with us would get it.  We had to isolate for 2 weeks so couldn't even go for a walk and our dogs both had leg surgery that they were recovering from and I had to do everything and it was immensely strssful.  At the same time her uncle was seriously unwelll with covid and we were worried he may be hospitalised.    My mother should be moving to her own place and this has been delayed - this is causing tension within the household as she rubs everyone up the wrong way.    My daughter has had a huge amount of anxiety, she is currently sleeping in a camp bed in my room as she cannot sleep alone and she obsesses about hand washing and hygiene and her hands are sore and dry.

421d5b9e,"I'm deeply passionate about new approaches to teaching and learning, and my greatest concern is with schools.     At this point, my child is very happy being at home and learning what she finds interesting and at her own pace. I am worried that the longer the crisis continues and my daughter gets used to a more relaxed model of learning, the more difficult it will be for her to re-adapt to the school environment when schools re-open.     We tried to home-school her, following the school recommendations, but this was very stressful for both my husband and myself, as well as for our daughter. We decided to prioritise her mental health and keep up with basic things such as reading, maths and science, and learning about things that we find are essential, such as feelings and emotions.     However, this is not what the traditional school system is about, and this will be even more true after the Covid crisis. As such, my concern is that if schools do not develop new ways of teaching, my daughter will struggle and will not thrive as she does at home.

My mother's health is already very fragile and my son's health has been an ongoing concern.  I fear that if the virus makes it into this household, it could kill all three of us (I consider myself 'healthy' but had childhood asthma and grew up with secondhand smoke) within a short period of time.  I do not share those specific concerns with my son.  I feel like he feels more comfortable with my being home vs. being at work.  But he is eager to see the few friends we communicate with and we have a regimen we follow to attempt to protect ourselves (gloves & masks outside, wiping down packages, doorknobs, etc. when we go out, hand washing and sanitizing continually and I have segregated dishes and towels). We take off our shoes as soon as we enter the house  He has adapted very well to these practices and I hope we can maintain health. Both my mother and my son have thought they had symptoms within the first two weeks of quarantine.  It made me realize how essential it is that I remain calm because they're both vulnerable and prone to increased anxiety.  ","Just as the pandemic was moving in, he'd begun to go with me to the library, walking with friends and meeting friends to socialize.
