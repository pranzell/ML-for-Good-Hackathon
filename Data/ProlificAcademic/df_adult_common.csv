3d04aeae,"I am making great strides with long-overdue projects at home. I think it is due to having no outside commitments or expectations or deadlines. There is no outside obligation requiring action from me. There is no opportunity to be evaluated or feel judged. It's as if the deadlines themselves were causing me to feel overwhelmed to the point of paralysis. Take away the deadlines and expectations (real and imagined) and I have been energized, inspired and motivated to finish tasks that have been screaming for attention for years. My home is finally getting the attention it needs and I can see the potential for vast improvements on day-to-day livability. My once beautiful outdoor respite has been a virtual junkyard for the last few years due to neglect. At the end of today, the garden path is cleared, Significant landscaping and structural improvements have been completed, over 350 loose bricks are being used by friends for a patio. Have you ever gathered, transported and delivered 350 bricks? I enclosed my laundry area so I have a mud room instead of an outside laundry area. Planning to finish the floor tonight. Hanging the door was a big hassle . . . AND, I have 2 pick-up truck loads of unusable trash ready to go PLUS enough unwanted clothes, toys and other items just waiting to be donated - at least 3 trips to the Salvation Army drop-off will be necessary. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
